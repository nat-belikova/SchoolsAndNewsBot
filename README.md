## SchoolsAndNewsBot

[@SchoolsAndNewsBot](https://t.me/SchoolsAndNewsBot) is a Telegram bot I created in my Python class at HSE.

After you have entered the school's name, the bot uses `requests` and `selenium` to parse the school's websites and sends you a message with the collected news.

The bot was deployed on a Heroku server.
